    <p> This was up there with one of the most challenging assignments I have completed at uni. It has taught me resilience, time management skills, patience, and persistence.
        Although I encountered errors when looking at the W3C validation markup service, I managed to adapt to this and correct all errors I was faced with. As I am a Apple Macbook user I have decided to face this assignment solely through GitHub, and with over 300 commits I believe I have truly shown trial and error.
        As this is my first programming unit alongside Introduction to Business Programming I believe I have already learnt an immense amount of knowledge to do with programming, in particular, HTML, CSS, and JS. These three languages will be what all websites and programs are based on, HTML being a markup language, CSS being a styling language, and JS being a programming language.
        HTML is the fundamental part of a website, it is what makes one run, CSS and JS are other technologies that assist in enhancing and modifying the HTML. CSS controls the presentation and layout of the website, JS controlling the function of certain elements, whether this be a program or animations run through the website to provide a better experience.
