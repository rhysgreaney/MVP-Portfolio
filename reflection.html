    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> General Reflection </h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> This was up there with one of the most challenging assignments I have completed at uni. It has taught me resilience, time management skills, patience, and persistence.
            Although I encountered errors when looking at the W3C validation markup service, I managed to adapt to this and correct all errors I was faced with. As I am a Apple Macbook user I have decided to face this assignment solely through GitHub, and with over 300 commits I believe I have truly shown trial and error.
            As this is my first programming unit alongside Introduction to Business Programming I believe I have already learnt an immense amount of knowledge to do with programming, in particular, HTML, CSS, and JS. These three languages will be what all websites and programs are based on, HTML being a markup language, CSS being a styling language, and JS being a programming language.
            HTML is the fundamental part of a website, it is what makes one run, CSS and JS are other technologies that assist in enhancing and modifying the HTML. CSS controls the presentation and layout of the website, JS controlling the function of certain elements, whether this be a program or animations run through the website to provide a better experience.
        </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Challenges Faced </h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            As mentioned above, this was one of my most challenging assignments I have completed, I faced several challenges throughout the assignment, some of which you may spot when looking at the website. Ideally, I would have liked a hero image, this just wasn't for me as no matter how much I tried I couldn't figure out a way to get it working.
            I would try to reposition the hero image, add it to the HTML, add it to the CSS, no matter what I couldn't get it working, this was very frustrating. I also believe a struggle of mine was avoiding div tags as they aren't semantic, I went back through the website to change them, should be sorted now. CSS styling didn't come natural to me, In a ideal world I would have liked to 
            move more styling from the HTML to the CSS as I believe it did get a little messy, but regardless I am very proud about what I have produced. Lastly, I would have liked to have got the contact form submit button working, I had run out of time, but I did have the thought of making it functioning with JS, much like the to-do list project that was completed a couple weeks ago.

        </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Success Faced </h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            The main success for me was to get the website working, I would never have thought I would make a functioning website that is live for the public to view, this is a huge accomplishment for someone so new to programming in my opinion. I was surprised how the website looks, regardless of not having a hero image I believe the choice of colours, the layout, and fonts used has done the
            website justice, and is rather pleasing on the eyes. Sticking to neutral colours, black, white, light grey, and dark grey, allowed for a minimalists approach to the website. I would also consider deploying a functioning website prior to it being due is a success, whilst also completing several other units. Now building a functioning website with six live links to use, I have seen that
            the sky is the limit when it comes to programming, anything is possible, especially if I could build a website. Although the workload for this assignment was immense it was completely rewarding as I managed to do all of this by myself and with the guidance of Michael Borck in class and the internet.
