        <p class = "portfolio-text"> HTML, this was the first project we developed, the first HTML website I have made. As we focused on HTML5, we used numerous known semantic tags including header, footer, section. These are very common tags. This website was purely HTML based with very little CSS.
            This is a pre-requisite for project two, where we expanded on CSS.</p>

        <p class = "portfolio-text"> This website was continued from the first week on content. As a class we expanded on CSS, this was to show that the further implementation of CSS would allow for a greater knowledge when it came to developing larger and more complicated websites.
            Taking the idea of tags and using them to then style certain string of code was also very handy when it came to developing this website. There are a lot of styling options that can be chosen, but using CSS can allow for the targeting of classes and the easy editing of stylesheets.</p>

            Rock Paper Scissors was my introduction to what is known as event-driven programming in javascripting (JS). Much like the first two projects we built a HTML website, followed by CSS to make the website look nicer, we then incorporated JS to allow for a game of rock, paper, scissors to be played. 
            We updated the interface of buttons made via the use of CSS as well as turning text to speech through the use of JS.

            Flatland was another HTML website that enabled the use of event-driven programming through JS. If a given user decides to click on the square they will be prompted with updated text through a buzz-word generator we also programmed.
            CSS was incorporated into this, when hovering over the square and clicking it, the square would change colour.

            RSS was a different form of coding, this was the introduction of a XHR request, the introduction of this allowed us to interact with servers. This project allows for heavy use of JS, it was a good exercise for learning more about what JS can do.
            We provide the website with an RSS link, this was found via the internet. The website then spits out the RSS feed to the webapge and provides any given content, the title, author, and date of release. This was a very helpful project as it provides a 
            further insight into JS and what it is capable of.

            To-Do List was by far the hardest of projects I have worked on during my programming stint. It involved the use of DOM, this allowed us to change the style, structure and content of the document. This project has allowed the user to make a checklist
            that has access to checkboxes, and when you have completed the item on the list you can tick it off and then the item is crossed out. Adding 3 other buttons to this allowed for further functionality, the user can choose to view 'all' tasks, any given 'active'
            tasks, and then a list of 'competed' tasks.
