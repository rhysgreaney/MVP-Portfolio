            Hi my name is Rhys Greaney, I am currently in my last year of study at Curtin University. 
            I have plans of entering the workforce either specialising in databases or business processes.
            Throughout my time at university I have learnt many things across a few different degree attempts,
            I finally settled for Business Information Technology and Information Systems.
