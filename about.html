            Hi my name is Rhys Greaney, I am currently in my last year of study at Curtin University. 
            I have plans of entering the workforce either specialising in databases or business processes.
            Throughout my time at university I have learnt many things across a few different degree attempts,
            I finally settled for Business Information Technology and Information Systems.

            I have a interest in programming, even though it is my first semester in the world of programming
            I have found myself drawn to it, I am currently completing Introduction to Business Programming and Business
            Web and Mobile Technologies. Both very different units but this unit is helping me understand the introductory
            unit.

            Some interests of mine outside of the world of university include; Golfing which I casually participate in on 
            weekdays, basketball which I have been playing for years and have enjoyed every moment of. I also enjoy
            watching sport this can include AFL, NBA, Olympics, all very enjoyable. I enjoy engaging in social activities 
            with friends, whether this be a night out or just lunch. Lastly, learning new and exciting things to do to my car, 
            even though I'm not a mechanic I enjoy working on cars.
